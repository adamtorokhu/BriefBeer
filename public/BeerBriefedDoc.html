              BriefBeer is a beer discovery and tracking application designed for enthusiasts who want to explore breweries and log their beer-related habits. Users can browse an existing global database of breweries, add their favorite breweries to their personal list, and view them on an interactive world map. The app allows users to manually track daily beer consumption through a streak system, manage their account, and optionally attach images to beers they like.
